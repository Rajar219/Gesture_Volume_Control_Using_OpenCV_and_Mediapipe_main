🖐️ Hand Gesture Volume ControlControl your system volume in real-time using nothing but your hand! This project leverages computer vision to bridge the gap between physical movements and digital commands.🌟 FeaturesReal-time Tracking: High-speed hand landmark detection via webcam.Intuitive Control: Volume levels map naturally to the distance between your thumb and index finger.Cross-Platform: Designed to work on most systems with a standard camera.Lightweight: Efficient processing using MediaPipe and OpenCV.🛠️ How It WorksCapture: The webcam streams live video frames to the Python script.Detection: MediaPipe identifies 21 unique hand landmarks.Calculation: The script measures the Euclidean distance between the Thumb Tip (ID 4) and Index Finger Tip (ID 8).Mapping:Greater Distance: Increases the system volume.Smaller Distance: Decreases the system volume.Execution: PyAutoGUI simulates the volume key presses on your OS.💻 
Technologies UsedPython: The core programming language.OpenCV: For video processing and image handling.MediaPipe: For robust hand landmark detection.PyAutoGUI: To interface with system volume controls.🚀 Getting StartedRequirementsEnsure you have Python installed, then install the necessary dependencies via pip:Bashpip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
UsageConnect your webcam.Run the main script:Bashpython volume_control_python.py
Position your hand in view of the camera.Pinch to lower volume; Spread your fingers to raise it.Press Esc to exit the application.📂 Project StructureFileDescriptionvolume_control_python.pyThe main executable script containing the detection logic and volume mapping.⚠️ Limitations & Future EnhancementsCurrent LimitationsRequires stable, adequate lighting for landmark detection.Dependent on system-specific volume key event support.Accuracy may fluctuate based on hand angle or distance from the camera.Roadmap[ ] Add an on-screen visual volume indicator (HUD).[ ] Implement additional gestures for Mute, Play, and Pause.[ ] Improve recognition accuracy using a Kalman filter for smoothing.👤 AuthorRAJA R 📧 leviraja670@hmail.com
